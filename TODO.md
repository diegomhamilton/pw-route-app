# TODO

- Fix weird routing where distances in y position seems to be favored
- Improve performance of new plots by keeping Map plotted and just updating plot of materials in active route
- Add support to routes in alternative maps
    - Need to provide specific maps and see if there's any way to have a single JSON database
